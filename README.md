# 🚀 8-Week AI-Integrated Next.js Roadmap (Job-Ready Portfolio)

**Author:** Fumika Mikami  
**Role Target:** AI-Ready Full-Stack Developer (Next.js / MERN-style backend)  
**Duration:** 8 Weeks · **~280 Hours** (5 hrs/day)  
**Cert Focus:** **Microsoft AI-900**  
**Deployment:** **Vercel (Next.js)** + **Render (API/Worker)** + **MongoDB Atlas (DB)**  
**Core Rule:** Touch **AI Travel Planner OR AI Expense Tracker at least 1 hour/day**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build **job-ready, production-style applications** that prove you can:
- Ship real products end-to-end (UI → API → DB → deploy)
- Integrate LLMs safely (structured outputs, guardrails, eval mindset)
- Build reliable systems (auth, RBAC, logs, background jobs, integrations)
- Present your work like a professional (READMEs, demos, architecture notes)
- Pass **AI-900** for an official “AI fundamentals” signal

> Goal outcome: If you complete this roadmap, applying for **MERN/Full-Stack roles** becomes much easier because your portfolio looks like real work, not tutorials.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Weeks | Hours | Outcome |
|------|------:|------:|--------|
| **Phase 0** | 1 | 35h | Environment + Repo setup + Deploy skeleton + AI-900 start |
| **Phase 1** | 2 | 70h | **AI Expense Tracker MVP** deployed + demo-ready |
| **Phase 2** | 3 | 70h | **AI Travel Planner MVP (Next.js)** deployed + saved itineraries |
| **Phase 3** | 4–6 | 105h | Integration + Reliability: RAG/citations, jobs/queues, audit logs, export, polish |
| **Phase 4** | 7–8 | 70h | (Optional 3rd mini-project) + Job-ready packaging + Interview prep |

> Total: ~280 hours (8 weeks × 7 days × 5 hours/day)

---

## 🗓️ Daily Routine (5 hours/day)

**Every day (non-negotiable):**
1) **1h** → Work on **either** Travel Planner **or** Expense Tracker  
2) **1.5h** → Main weekly build goal (the roadmap milestone)  
3) **1h** → **AI-900 study** (Weeks 1–4 heavy; Weeks 5–8 light review)  
4) **1h** → Engineering skills (auth/security/testing/deployment/system design)  
5) **0.5h** → Portfolio output (README updates, screenshots, demo notes)

---

# ✅ Phase 0 — Setup + Skeleton Deploy (Week 1)

## Goals
- Create strong foundations to avoid deployment pain later
- Deploy *early* (even if features are not ready)

## Tasks
### Project Setup
- Create 2 repos:
  - `globeguide-ai` (AI Travel Planner)
  - `ai-expense-tracker`
- Initialize **Next.js + TypeScript** in both
- Add ESLint + Prettier + absolute imports
- Add `.env.example` + config conventions

### Deploy Setup
- Deploy both to **Vercel** (blank is fine)
- Create MongoDB Atlas cluster + separate DBs/collections per project
- Decide auth approach (recommended: email/password first; add Google OAuth later)

### Backend Structure (recommended)
- Next.js app for UI + lightweight API routes
- Use **Render** for heavier API + background worker (jobs/queues)
- Store secrets in Vercel/Render env settings (never in code)

### AI-900 Start
- Begin AI-900 learning path (1 hour/day)

**Week 1 Definition of Done**
- Both apps deployed on Vercel with working home pages
- DB connected with a health-check endpoint/page
- Repos have clean READMEs + environment templates
- AI-900 study started

---

# ✅ Phase 1 — AI Expense Tracker (Week 2)

## Project Goal
A production-style expense tracker with AI-assisted extraction:
> “I spent £20 on a burger” → structured JSON → stored in DB

## Core Features (MVP)
- Auth + protected dashboard
- Transactions CRUD (add/edit/delete)
- Categories + monthly summary
- Chart dashboard (Chart.js/Recharts)
- AI feature:
  - NLP → structured extraction (amount, category, date, notes)
  - or auto-categorization + brief “monthly insight”

## Engineering Must-Haves
- Validation + error handling
- Loading states + empty states
- Basic logging

**Week 2 Definition of Done**
- Expense Tracker deployed, stable, demoable
- 60–90s demo video recorded
- README includes screenshots + features + setup steps

---

# ✅ Phase 2 — AI Travel Planner (Week 3)

## Project Goal
A modern **Next.js** travel planner that generates itineraries and stores them.

## Core Features (MVP)
- Auth + saved itineraries per user
- Itinerary generation endpoint (LLM)
- UI: day-by-day itinerary layout (timeline or cards)
- Save + view past itineraries
- Nice-to-have: streaming generation for better UX

## Engineering Must-Haves
- Strong prompt structure + JSON output schema
- Retry/fallback behavior on malformed output
- Basic rate limiting strategy (at least per-user throttling)

**Week 3 Definition of Done**
- Travel Planner deployed, stable, demoable
- Saved itineraries working
- README includes architecture summary + screenshots

---

# ✅ Phase 3 — Integration + Reliability + “Real Work” Signals (Weeks 4–6)

## Week 4 — AI-900 Exam + Hardening Week
### AI-900
- Practice tests + revise weak areas
- **Take AI-900 this week**

### Hardening Tasks (both apps)
- Improve error boundaries, UX loading states
- Add request validation (Zod recommended)
- Add structured logging (request ID, user ID, error trace)
- Security basics:
  - protect routes
  - safe env handling
  - sanitize inputs

**Week 4 Definition of Done**
- AI-900 passed ✅
- Both apps feel stable and professional

---

## Week 5 — RAG + Citations + Integrations (Travel Planner Focus)
### Travel Planner Upgrades
- “Bring your own notes” feature:
  - upload text/PDF notes (or paste notes)
  - chunk + embed + retrieve relevant context
  - itinerary includes **citations**
- Add 1 integration:
  - Places search, maps, weather, events, etc.

**Week 5 Definition of Done**
- Travel Planner has RAG + citations + one real external API integration

---

## Week 6 — Background Jobs + Audit Logs + Export (Expense Tracker Focus)
### Expense Tracker Upgrades
- Add export (CSV/PDF)
- Add audit logs (who created/edited/deleted transactions)
- Add a background job:
  - monthly report generation
  - or re-categorization batch job
  - or scheduled insights email (mock)

### Reliability Upgrades
- retries/failures handled cleanly
- queue or scheduled worker runs on Render

**Week 6 Definition of Done**
- Expense Tracker has “enterprise signals”: export + audit logs + jobs

---

# ✅ Phase 4 — Optional 3rd Project + Job-Ready Packaging (Weeks 7–8)

## Option A (Recommended): Mini Project 3 — AI Knowledge Base (RAG SaaS)
A small but powerful demo for “AI Integration Engineer” roles:
- Upload docs → chat with citations
- RBAC (admin/user)
- Logs + feedback button
- Deploy + demo

## Option B: Polish the 2 Flagship Apps Deeply
- Performance + caching
- Better design system
- More integrations
- Add Google OAuth (if not already)

---

## Week 8 — Portfolio + Interview Prep + “Hire Me” Assets

### Portfolio Deliverables
- Clean READMEs (setup, env vars, features, screenshots)
- Architecture diagram (simple)
- 2 demo videos (Travel + Expense)
- GitHub pinned repos + short project descriptions
- CV bullets written from your shipped features

### Interview Prep (daily)
- Explain architecture decisions:
  - auth, DB schema, API design
  - LLM structured output, RAG, prompt injection awareness
  - rate limiting, logging, background jobs
- Prepare “project walkthrough” answers (STAR format)

**Week 8 Definition of Done**
- 2 (or 3) deployed apps
- demos + READMEs complete
- CV + LinkedIn updated
- ready to apply confidently
